# Beyond Costs: Mapping Norwegian Youth Preferences for a More Inclusive Energy Transition

This repository contains data analysis files associated with the workshops conducted as part of the interdisciplinary research project "Energy for Future," which aims to assess youth perspectives on Norway's future net-zero energy system.

The purpose of this repository is to facilitate understanding of the quantitative analysis and reflections based on students' perspectives and preferences. The repository will be maintained and updated as the project progresses, reflecting new data from ongoing workshops.
